## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I finally got to apply javascript to my webpage and really get a feel of dom manipulation. It was such a fun and engaging projectüòÅ

```js
// const proudOfThisJs = () => {
  const menuItems = ['Product', 'Company', 'Connect'];
for (const item of menuItems) {
  const arrow = document.querySelector(`#${item} .arrow`);
  const menuItem = document.getElementById(`${item}`);
  menuItem.onclick = () => {
    arrow.classList.toggle('rotate-down');
    console.log('Arrow flipped');
    menuItem.classList.toggle('clicked');
    const dropdown = document.querySelector(`#${item} .dropdown`);
    console.log(dropdown);
    if (dropdown) {
      dropdown.classList.toggle('visible');
    }
  };
}

// }
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn more about javascript and how to use it to make my webpages more interactive.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with the javascript code for the hamburger menu. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
